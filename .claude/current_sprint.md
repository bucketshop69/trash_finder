# Current Sprint - Gorbagana Trash Finder

## Sprint Rules
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Focus on single task until completion
- **All active tasks MUST be listed in this file**
- **Update this file whenever starting/completing tasks**
- **Reference this file at the start of each session**

## Current Sprint Goal
Sprint 2.3: Movement & Room System Implementation

**FOCUS**: Implement hybrid movement system based on our design discussions

## Active Tasks

### In Progress
- [ ] Test key collection inside Room1

### Completed in This Sprint ✅
- [x] Fix collision system - implement simplified door-based collision only
- [x] Add room state tracking (detect which room player is in)
- [x] Implement entrance door from spawn to room1 
- [x] Implement 9x9 grid system for Room1 only
- [x] Remove extra rooms (2, 3, center) for testing
- [x] Add spawn position outside Room1
- [x] Create room prison system (player trapped once inside)
- [x] Test movement: spawn → enter room → trapped inside ✅

### Next Steps - Object & Key System  
- [ ] Verify key collection works with room state validation
- [ ] Add more rooms and doors (room2, room3, center)
- [ ] Add door unlocking system when keys collected
- [ ] Test complete game flow: spawn → collect keys → unlock doors

### Future - Grid System Foundation
- [ ] Expand 9x9 grid system to all rooms
- [ ] Plan object placement strategy using grid zones  
- [ ] Create object categories (furniture, decorations, interactive)

## Architecture Decisions Made
Based on brainstorming sessions (documented in `/docs/maze-design.md`):

1. **Movement System**: Hybrid approach
   - Smooth X,Y coordinate movement (no teleportation)
   - Invisible room state tracking for game logic
   - Door-based collision only (no complex wall collision)

2. **Room System**: State tracking
   - `player.currentRoom = "spawn" | "room1" | "room2" | "room3" | "center"`
   - Used for: lighting, key collection, multiplayer sync
   - Updated automatically as player moves

3. **Object Placement**: 9x9 grid per room (future)
   - Desperados-inspired environmental richness
   - Layered randomness for balanced placement
   - "Trashy office" theme with appropriate objects

## ✅ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED!
**Problem SOLVED**: Player can now enter Room1 and is trapped inside (as intended)
**Room System WORKING**: Player state tracking functional
**Prison System SUCCESS**: Once inside Room1, player cannot escape but moves freely inside

## Current Focus
Testing key collection system inside the trapped room environment.

## Completed ✅
- [x] Sprint 1.1: Project Structure Setup 
- [x] Sprint 1.2: Frontend Base Setup  
- [x] Sprint 1.3: Backend Base Setup
- [x] Sprint 2.1: Game World Creation (2x2 maze)
- [x] Sprint 2.2: Initial collision detection (needs simplification)
- [x] Sprint 2.3: Movement & Room System (MAJOR SUCCESS!)
- [x] Architecture discussions and design documentation
- [x] Grid-based room system foundation
- [x] Room state tracking and prison mechanics

## Notes
- All design decisions documented in `/docs/maze-design.md`
- Grid system and advanced features planned for future sprints
- Focus on getting basic movement and key collection working first
