## Sprint 3.3 Implementation Plan

### Win Conditions Design
- **Key Requirement**: 3 keys required to claim treasure
- **Testing Mode**: Single-player only (for now)
- **Key Placement**: Keep current key locations (strategic placement in dedicated sprint later)
- **Treasure Interaction**: Player must press SPACE near treasure to claim
- **Key Requirement Display**: Show "Need 3 keys" near treasure
- **UI Display**: Show player's current key count: "Keys: X/3"

### Victory System
- **Victory Screen**: Simple overlay "Player One Won!" 
- **Game End**: Show victory overlay with back button to lobby
- **No Hand-holding**: Players discover key requirements through gameplay
