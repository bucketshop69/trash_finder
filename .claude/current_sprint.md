# Current Sprint - Gorbagana Trash Finder

## Sprint Rules
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Focus on single task until completion
- **All active tasks MUST be listed in this file**
- **Update this file whenever starting/completing tasks**
- **Reference this file at the start of each session**

## Current Sprint Goal
**Sprint 2.3: Multiplayer Synchronization - ACTIVE**

**FOCUS**: Transform local multiplayer into networked real-time multiplayer using existing server foundation

## Sprint 2.3 Implementation Plan

### Multiplayer Architecture
- **Server Foundation**: Existing Node.js + Socket.io + Redis server
- **Integration Strategy**: Adapt server GameState to match client 3x3 maze layout
- **Real-Time Sync**: Socket.io for movement, key collection, and game state
- **Authority Model**: Server-authoritative for all game-changing events

## MICRO TASKS - Sprint 2.3

### Phase 1: Server-Client Integration (Foundation)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Update server GameState to use 3x3 maze layout (match client)
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Sync server spawn positions with client spawn positions  
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Update server key/treasure positions to match client MazeGenerator
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Test server game state generation matches client expectations

### Phase 2: Client Socket Integration
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Add Socket.io client dependency to client package.json
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Create client-side Socket manager/service
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add connection UI (connect/disconnect buttons)
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Test basic client-server connection handshake

### Phase 3: Real-Time Movement Sync
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Send player movement from client to server via Socket.io
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Broadcast movement updates to other players
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Update remote player positions on client
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Test smooth dual-player movement synchronization

### Phase 4: Game State Synchronization
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Sync key collection events (client â†’ server â†’ broadcast)
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Sync treasure interaction events 
- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Sync game win conditions and victory states
- [ ] **Task 4.4**: Handle game state conflicts and authority resolution

### Phase 5: Room & Matchmaking System
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Add lobby/queue UI to client
- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Implement join queue functionality
- [ ] **Task 5.3**: Handle room creation and player matching
- [ ] **Task 5.4**: Test full room lifecycle (join â†’ play â†’ leave)

### Phase 6: Error Handling & Polish
- [ ] **Task 6.1**: Handle player disconnection gracefully  
- [ ] **Task 6.2**: Add reconnection logic and game pause
- [ ] **Task 6.3**: Add network lag compensation
- [ ] **Task 6.4**: Test edge cases and network reliability

## Success Criteria
âœ… Two players can join from different browsers/devices  
âœ… Real-time movement visible to both players  
âœ… Fair key collection with server authority  
âœ… Synchronized win conditions  
âœ… Graceful disconnection handling  

## Current Status
**SPRINT 2.3 STARTED!** ðŸš€ Ready to implement networked multiplayer using existing server foundation.

**Next Task**: Task 1.1 - Update server GameState to use 3x3 maze layout
