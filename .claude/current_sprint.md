# Current Sprint - Gorbagana Trash Finder

## Sprint Rules
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - Focus on single task until completion
- **All active tasks MUST be listed in this file**
- **Update this file whenever starting/completing tasks**
- **Reference this file at the start of each session**

## Current Sprint Goal
**Sprint 4.0: Wall Architecture & Visual Polish COMPLETE**

**FOCUS**: Professional wall system with proper architectural design and clean visual presentation

## COMPLETED TASKS ✅

### **Wall Architecture System**
1. ✅ **Wall Hierarchy Implementation** - Different thicknesses for exterior (16px), interior (12px), internal (8px) walls
2. ✅ **Mixed Perspective Walls** - Horizontal walls show full face, vertical walls show edge view  
3. ✅ **Clean Wall Gaps** - Replaced door graphics with architectural openings in walls
4. ✅ **Smart Gap Detection** - Only creates gaps for doors that connect to specific rooms
5. ✅ **Single Building Entry** - Only ROOM_0_0 connects to spawn, removed extra entrances

### **Visual Polish System**
6. ✅ **Removed Visual Clutter** - Eliminated green door boxes and yellow key circles
7. ✅ **Object Simplification** - Removed desks, chairs, computers - kept only trash bins and light switches
8. ✅ **Collision-Free Gaps** - 30px wide door openings with no collision detection
9. ✅ **Subtle Floor Tiles** - Added 9x9 grid texture with soft, barely visible lines (0.5px, 10% opacity)
10. ✅ **Room-Based Interaction** - Fixed cross-room object interaction bug

## Technical Achievements

### **Wall System Architecture**
- **Wall Types**: Exterior (dark, thick), Interior (medium), Internal (light, thin)
- **Perspective Rendering**: Horizontal = elevation view, Vertical = plan view
- **Gap System**: Smart detection based on door connections to rooms
- **Material Texturing**: Stone courses with mortar lines, different patterns per wall type

### **Visual Design Improvements**
- **Clean Aesthetic**: Removed competing visual elements (door graphics, circles)
- **Architectural Consistency**: All elements follow same perspective and thickness rules
- **Professional Polish**: Subtle details that enhance without distracting
- **Spatial Clarity**: Clear boundaries, obvious passages, logical object placement

## Current State
**Sprint 4.0 COMPLETE** - The game now has a professional architectural wall system with clean visual design. All walls have proper hierarchy, clean gaps for passage, and subtle floor texturing. The building has a single entry point and collision-free movement through doorways.

## Next Sprint Preparation
Ready for Sprint 5.0 based on user priorities:
- Gameplay mechanics (key collection, win conditions)
- Multiplayer systems (player sync, real-time gameplay)  
- Advanced lighting (better flashlight, room effects)
- Audio system (sound effects, ambient audio)
